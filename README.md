# socket-chat

A little exercise socket broadcast chat Swing application. It consists of two separate JARs:

1. A **socket server** that listens for incoming connections and broadcasts messages to all connected **socket clients
   **.
2. A Java Swing **socket client** that connects to the **socket server** and allows the user to send messages to it.

Note: this project is not my proudest work, because the code feels very messy and ugly.
