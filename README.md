This is a Java socket broadcast chat Swing application for a university course project, built as Maven multi-module project. 
It's not my proudest work, because the code feels very messy and ugly.

## Features

- **Socket Server**: Listens for incoming connections and broadcasts messages to all connected clients in real-time.
- **Socket Client**: Connects to the server and allows the user to send messages.
- **Swing GUI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for the client to interact with the server.
- **Multithreading**: For handling multiple clients simultaneously using threads.
